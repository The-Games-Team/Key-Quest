# Key-Quest

You are a bot (?) who needs to work through 25 levels to reach the goal. In each level, you have to pick up the key, go through the door, and make sure you don't run out of time. There are 3 difficulty modes, as well as a speedrunning mode if you just want to complete the game as quickly as possible. Have fun!
